This note only focus on the 1D selective pulses. 

## Basics and characteristics of MRI pulses
The behavior of the magnetization is described by the Bloch equation

$$\text{Bloch equation}:\quad \frac{d\mathbf{M}}{dt} = \mathbf{M} \times \gamma \mathbf{B}$$

where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field (the relaxation is ignored here). 


The followings are some characteristics of RF pulses:
- peak value
- flip angle
- time-bandwidth product


## Examples
### Rectangular pulse
