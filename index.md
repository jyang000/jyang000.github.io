<font style="font-size:15pt;font-family:monospace;text-shadow: 3px 3px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);">Hi! I'm Jiayao Yang. <br>Welcome to my personal website!</font>

I'm a PhD candidate in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) department at [University of Michgan - Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), majoring in Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning. I'm fortunate to be co-advised by [Jon-Fredrik Nielsen](https://bme.umich.edu/people/jon-fredrik-nielsen/) and [Yun Jiang](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/radiology/yun-jiang-phd). My research interests include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), signal processing, numerical optimization, and machine learning.
