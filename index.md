<font style="font-size:15pt;font-family:monospace;text-shadow: 3px 3px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);">Hi! I'm Jiayao Yang. <br>Welcome to my personal website!</font>

I'm a PhD candidate in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) department at [University of Michgan - Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), majoring in Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning. I'm fortunate to be co-advised by [Jon-Fredrik Nielsen](https://websites.umich.edu/~jfnielse/) and [Yun Jiang](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/radiology/yun-jiang-phd). My current research explores new algorithms for multidimensional pulses design in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using optimization methods and their applications to reduced field-of-view imaging. I'm also interested in developing new algorithms for MRI combining signal processing knowledge and machine learning.
