Hi, my name is Jiayao Yang.

I am a PhD student majoring in Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning of EECS department in [University of Michgan - Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/) co-advised by [Jon-Fredrik Nielsen](https://bme.umich.edu/people/jon-fredrik-nielsen/) and [Yun Jiang](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/radiology/yun-jiang-phd). My research interests include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), signal processing, optimization, and machine learning.
