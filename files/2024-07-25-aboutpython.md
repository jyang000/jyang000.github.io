As a Python user, many things may seem unnecessary in the coding but can be quite helpful.

**Type annotation**

For example, 
```python
def f(x:int, y:int) -> int:
    '''Return sum for ints.'''
    return x+y
```
```python
class A:
    '''a class for demonstration.'''

def create_A_instance() -> A:
    '''Return an instance of A.'''
    return A()
```
